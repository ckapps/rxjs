#### ðŸ“¦ packge moved ðŸ“¢

As so often in programming, naming this package just `@ckapp/rxjs` wasn't the best idea. To acknowledge that I messed this up, I decided to rename it to [`@ckapp/rxjs-snafu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckapp/rxjs-snafu)

<hr />

# @ckapp/rxjs

A collection of extensions for the awesome [RxJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs) library.
